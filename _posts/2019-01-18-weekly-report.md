# [Weekly Report]({% post_url 2019-01-18-weekly-report %})

## Things I Did
- Setup Transparent aero overlay from [https://github.com/ReactiioN1337/aero-overlay](https://github.com/ReactiioN1337/aero-overlay)
- Added lag fix for windows 10 RS2 from one of the fork's commit [https://github.com/rossnichols/aero-overlay/commit/969397f0fe47fc0caddef294e6ef398e13cc1c67](https://github.com/rossnichols/aero-overlay/commit/969397f0fe47fc0caddef294e6ef398e13cc1c67)
- Calling scale_overlay function inside a loop to follow target window everytime the user moves it.

## Things I Am Going To Do

## Problems
- Scaling the target window also scales the stuff being rendered on the overlay.
