# [Project A Proposal]({% post_url 2019-01-11-project-a-proposal %})

## Transparent D3DX9 Overlay with ImGui
I choose a Windows C++ project in which I will be integrating and using ImGui to create a decent GUI on a transparent overlay that can overlap any open windows of a process.

## Reason
I have a passion for game hacking i.e. developing cheats/hacks for popular multiplayer games for windows. Currently i have a working overlay with a simple toggle-able line based GUI but the overlay is not very well coded and lacks good performance. Also ImGui will provide a highly customisable and good looking GUI for better controlling and configuring the cheats/hacks i develop. This project will provide me with a good base for my future and current project.

## References
